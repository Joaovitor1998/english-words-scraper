## English News Vocab Scraper

### This is a Web Scraping Program
### The purpose of this application is to show the real used words in day to day life. It'll help me a lot during vocab learning.
#### There's still a lot to do in this project, such as a better word sanitizer, mark a word as known, the meaning for each word, etc, but it is useable anyway.

This is a Spring Boot Application that scrapes the most recent news from a website and retrieve the words used in that news.

On the home page you can see the most recent news title. When you click on its link it'll redirect you to the news detail page where you can see its title, text and the list of words used in that text.
